# Workers Directory

This directory is reserved for background workers and scheduled jobs.

## Future Implementation Plans

- **Email notifications**: Background worker for sending email notifications to clients
- **File processing**: Worker for processing uploaded files (thumbnails, optimization)
- **Cleanup jobs**: Scheduled cleanup of expired tokens and old files
- **Analytics**: Background processing of usage analytics and reporting
- **Backup workers**: Automated database backups and maintenance

## Usage

Workers will be implemented using background job queues and can be triggered by:
- API events (new project, message sent, etc.)
- Scheduled cron jobs
- Manual triggers from admin interface

Each worker should be implemented as a separate service class with proper error handling and logging.
